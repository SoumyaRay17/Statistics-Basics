        "Skewness in data refers to a lack of symmetry in a distribution. It measures how much a dataset deviates from a normal distribution, where the mean, median, and mode are all equal. In simpler terms, skewness indicates if the data is more spread out on one side of the mean compared to the other."

        "\n",
        "Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the \"tailedness\" of a probability distribution. It quantifies how much the distribution's tails deviate from the tails of a normal distribution.\n",

        "Key Takeaway: Kurtosis is a valuable tool for understanding the shape and behavior of a distribution, particularly its tails, which can provide insights into the presence of outliers and the overall risk associated with the data."

        "Covariance in statistics serves as a measure of how two variables change together. It indicates the direction of their relationship, whether they tend to increase or decrease together (positive covariance), or one increases while the other decreases (negative covariance). Essentially, covariance helps understand the joint variability of two variables.\n",

If one goes up while the other goes down, the covariance is negative. It's a way to look at how two things are changing relative to each other, but it doesn't tell you how strongly they're related or how much they're related, according to some sources."
